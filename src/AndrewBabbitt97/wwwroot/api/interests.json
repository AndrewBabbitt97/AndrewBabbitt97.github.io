  "Living in the wonderful state of Colorado grants me the opportunity to really go out and take in nature. I love to go hiking, white water rafting, or even just exploring the mountains and rivers available to me. Aside from that I love to go bowling, brewery hopping, and just enjoying what life has to offer.",
  "When indoors, I love cooking and programming for hobby projects. I love to watch hockey and movies on occasion, do some gaming, and especially keep up with the latest advancements in technology. I always try to make the most out of life any chance I get."
